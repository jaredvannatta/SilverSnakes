Problem Statement


Team Silver Snakes intends to use the PICO-8 engine and development platform using Lua to create a tile based (possibly procedurally generated) RPG game. 
Development and team duties are ongoing and changing as we better understand what is required of us to complete the assignment to our satisfaction. 
Our team is new to these systems and will be learning them as the semester progresses. 
PICO-8 offers a novel design platform with a lot of support and tutorials that are available to new developers. 
We intend to use all resources that are available to us to create an exciting game that at its core is fun to play. 
There is a substantial amount of activity on the PICO-8 forums, YouTube videos and other developed projects to reference for ideas and implementation concepts. 
In the following we will outline what our intentions are for the finished project as necessary, desired, and optional requirements. 
We will then discuss who is likely to be responsible for each task. 
It should be noted, team member duties are likely to change as our understanding of the system evolves during development. 

As required by the class, all code will be shared and distributed amongst the team members through Git, with GitHub being the primary platform for file access and manipulation.
This project will be similar to other tile based RPG games such as Fire Emblem. 
The player will start on a square on the game map, and be able to select the player character and move a set number of tiles. 
When the player is in the vicinity (within 1 or 2 tiles depending on ranged or melee attack) of an enemy, the player will have the ability to engage in a turn-based fight with enemies. 
We expect to develop a medieval-like fantasy world, where the player will move above ground to explore, interact with items and the world, or fight enemies. 
We also intend to implement dungeons or caves for the player to explore for better rewards. 
The narrative structure of this project is still being developed, but at its core we intend to follow a standard hero/anti-hero archetype ending with the capturing of an important item, or defeating a final boss. 
At its current stage we do not have any definite conceptions of the length of the project. 
If we can end the semester with a functioning game in which the player can move about the environment, explore, fight enemies in a turn based format, and reach a win state, we will consider that a general success. 

Next we will detail team member duties and the primary, secondary, and tertiary features of each sub-project. 

Jared intends to develop the map, map artifacts, environmental interactions, and sound for the game. 
This will include developing a believable and interesting space for the player to interact with, create the tile based framework for players to move within, and entry and barrier points for the sprite. 
These are primary concerns and are considered necessary for the core experience of the game. 
Secondarily, creating interesting and varied map artifacts that provide differing levels of interaction would be interesting and challenging to implement. 
The team also considered having a procedurally generated tile based dungeon system, where players could enter caves or castles that had random maps upon entry. 
If time permits, developing fully custom map artifacts and sound would add a level of personalization and fun to the project that would make it more original and fun for the team. 

Lance will implement the combat system for the game. 
This will include the player and enemy attacking in turns, and doing damage based on stats held by both the player and the enemy, and removing sprites from the game upon defeat. 
If the player is killed the game should enter a menu state to allow for a reset. 
Our primary aim is to create functional combat that puts turn based combat into effect and allows for damage to be dealt and received. 
These two things are core components of the game and necessary for play. 
We would like to implement a greater level of complexity to the combat system by adding stats to each player that will augment potential damage dealt, potential damage received, damage type (magic, ranged, or melee), and a speed statistic that would decide who went first in combat. 
If time permits it would be exciting to implement weapon types and weapon proficiency for the characters to augment damage done. 
Animating these things in a recognizable way would also be a fun challenge to add a level of originality to our game. 

Derek will work to implement the menu screens and general system administration. 
The core functionality of these systems should allow the player to play, pause, and exit the game from a built in menu system. 
Upon launch the player should enter a title screen that displays information about the game and is able to launch from this screen, view options about the game, and look at the controls for the game. 
We believe these are core functionalities that must be implemented for function. 
If time permits, having a mechanic to save the game state and allow the player to return to the same game state at a different session would add a level of authenticity to the project. 

Finally, Ernesto will work to implement the item management and object manipulation for the game. 
We intend to have different weapons and perhaps armor for the player. 
Consequently this function requires inventory management for the character such as a bag or vault for these items. 
Creating these items and allowing them to play a role in the type of damage our character does, and the way our character receives damage is a core mechanic. 
Developing a way to manipulate these objects and interact with them is a key feature in our project. 
Secondarily, creating a vendor system that allows for purchase or trade of items held by the player would add a level of immersion to the game. 

In conclusion, Team Silver Snakes intends to create a tile based RPG game. 
This game will have medieval themes and allow the player to move across the map and interact with dungeons, items and combat enemies. 
We are still in the early planning stages of this project and are trying to be aware of scope while developing a game that is fun, exciting, and challenging for all who are involved.
Developing the game on PICO-8 allows us to interact with a novel platform that offers functionality we could not usually achieve otherwise. 
As a whole, we are excited to take the project further and expound upon the concepts we have outlined in our problem statement.
