Problem Statements


Team Silver Snakes intends to use the PICO-8 engine and development platform using Lua to create a tilebased (possibly procedurally generated) RPG game. 
Development and team duties are ongoing and changing as we better understand what is required of us to complete the assignment to our satisfaction. 
Our team is new to these systems and will be learning them as the semester progresses. 
In the following we will outline what our intentions are for the finished project as necessary, desired, and optional requirements. 
We will then discuss who is likely to be responsible for each tasks. 
It should be noted, team member duties are likely to change as our understanding of the system evolves during development. 

As required by the class, all code will be shared and distributed amongst the team members through Git, with GitHub being the primary platform for file access and manipulation.
