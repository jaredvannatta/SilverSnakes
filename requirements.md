1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of Product
A simple RPG game developed in Pico-8 that allows the user to explore a created world, fight monsters, and complete a set of tasks to end the game. 

1.2 Scope of Product
This will be a short game that focuses on mechanic competency over length and complexity. We hope to allow a player to move and interact with the world, pick up items, and fight monsters to reach the end of the game. We will create conditions for the player to win the game, lose by taking damage, and modify character stats. This will not be an 8-bit version of Skyrim. 

1.3 Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions
Pico-8 refers to the development platform we are using.

1.4 References
