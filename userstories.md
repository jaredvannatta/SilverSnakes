User Story 1: 

As a user/gamer I want a 2D tile based RPG that is both fun and engaging. 
Elaboration: The player should be able to move through a medieval style world and engage in turn based combat. It would also be great if the player had stats that influenced combat capability and had an inventory to manage. 

Effort Estimation: About 40 person hours. 

Acceptance Test: Playing the game, moving through the world and engaging in combat.
