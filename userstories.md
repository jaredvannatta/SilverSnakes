User Story 1: 

As a user/gamer I want a 2D tile based RPG that is both fun and engaging. 
Elaboration: The player should be able to move through a medieval style world and engage in turn based combat. It would also be great if the player had stats that influenced combat capability and had an inventory to manage. 

Effort Estimation: About 40 person hours. 

Acceptance Test: Playing the game, moving through the world and engaging in combat.

User Story 3: 
As a student, but more importantly, as a member of the fabled game dev team, TEAM SILVER SNAKES, I want to craft a masterpiece of a game that will actually make me want to play video games. Also, an A on the project would be a nice bonus.

Elaboration: Players of the game should be able to move through the fictional world, interact with different characters/objects on the map, and engage in battle. Ideally we will have menus and text that will help guide player decisions.

Constraints: The only contraints are time-based contraints due to full course loads of our dev team members.

Effort Estimation: 40 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Conduct a full play through of the game, from start to finish. Ideally we will have players from outside the team test the game as well. Once we feel the game is to standard, we can accept it as a finished product. 


User Story 4:
As a user/gamer, who has played a large variety of role-playing games (RPG), I want a role-playing game that while it takes inspiration from similar games, has something that both makes it unique and stand out from the rest.

Elaboration: Players should be able to do a lot of the things that makes an RPG an RPG. This includes moving, leveling up, fighting, item management, experience a story as well as new mechanics to make the game unique like environmental challenges such as arrows the player has to dodge and traps they have to avoid.

Constraints: One big constraint is time, only having a little more than a month to finish this project as well as work from other courses can cause concern about whether the specified software can be delivered.

Effort Estimation: 100 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Have people from outside Team Silver Snakes who have played these types of games before play the game and only consider the project acceptable until the majority of the feedback received is positive.


User Story 5:
As a user/consumer, who has very little experience playing video games in general, I want a game that can easily grab my attention and makes me want to keep playing despite having close to no experience playing games. 

Elaboration: Players should feel that the game is welcoming to new players and that the game contains elements that can keep their attention, such as an intriguing plot that makes them want to play until the end or interesting gameplay mechanics that make playing the game fun while still having them experience the gameplay mechanics and challenges that make RPG games interesting and fun.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 50 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Have multiple people who have little experience playing video games play the game and consider it successful if they all are able to get to the end of the game.  


User Story 6:
As a user/gamer, I want a role-playing game that is easily accessible to both players who have very little or no experience playing role playing games, while still being interesting and challenging for people familiar with these kinds of games.

Elaboration: The controls of the games should be easy to understand and take into consideration both experienced and inexperienced players. Players should be able to easily identify which character they are controlling as well as their goal to complete the game.

Constraints: A constraint or difficulty I believe the team would run into is on balancing the game for both experienced and inexperienced players. For example, balancing the difficulty so that new players donâ€™t feel that the enemy is too strong or that the game is too difficult to be enjoyed, while keeping the game challenging and interesting to the experienced players.

Effort Estimation: 50 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Have multiple people of different levels of experience play the game, once the game can be completed by both, we can accept it as successful.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 40 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Have multiple people play through the game and have them defeat multiple enemies. The game will be considered successful if most of the players can defeat all of the enemies.

As a video game speed runner, who has set a few world records before, I want a game that allows me to strive to set the world record for the fastest time beating the game.
