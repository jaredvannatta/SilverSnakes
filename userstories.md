User Story 1: 

As a user/gamer I want a 2D tile based RPG that is both fun and engaging. 
Elaboration: The player should be able to move through a medieval style world and engage in turn based combat. It would also be great if the player had stats that influenced combat capability and had an inventory to manage. 

Effort Estimation: About 40 person hours. 

Acceptance Test: Playing the game, moving through the world and engaging in combat. 


User Story 2:

As a student of CS 371 I want to get an A on our game so that I can pass CS 371 and progress toward graduation.
Elaboration: We need to continually work on making our game that functions and meets all the requirements of the assignments each week.

Effort Estimation: About 40 person hours. 

Acceptance Test: Our game works as intended and we recieve an A on all of the assignments.


User Story 3: 
As a student, but more importantly, as a member of the fabled game dev team, TEAM SILVER SNAKES, I want to craft a masterpiece of a game that will actually make me want to play video games. Also, an A on the project would be a nice bonus.

Elaboration: Players of the game should be able to move through the fictional world, interact with different characters/objects on the map, and engage in battle. Ideally we will have menus and text that will help guide player decisions.

Constraints: The only contraints are time-based contraints due to full course loads of our dev team members.

Effort Estimation: 40 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Conduct a full play through of the game, from start to finish. Ideally we will have players from outside the team test the game as well. Once we feel the game is to standard, we can accept it as a finished product.
