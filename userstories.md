User Story 1: 

As a user/gamer I want a 2D tile based RPG that is both fun and engaging. 
Elaboration: The player should be able to move through a medieval style world and engage in turn based combat. It would also be great if the player had stats that influenced combat capability and had an inventory to manage. 

Effort Estimation: About 40 person hours. 

Acceptance Test: Playing the game, moving through the world and engaging in combat. 


User Story 2:

As a student of CS 371 I want to get an A on our game so that I can pass CS 371 and progress toward graduation.
Elaboration: We need to continually work on making our game that functions and meets all the requirements of the assignments each week.

Effort Estimation: About 40 person hours. 

Acceptance Test: Our game works as intended and we recieve an A on all of the assignments.
