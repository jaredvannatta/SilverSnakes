This project uses the PICO-8 engine to deploy a RPG game. This game requires the PICO-8 software to run and play on a local machine as it is not deployed through a browswer. 
The only required file to play the game is silversnakes.p8, all assets are inside the file. 


A Note on Repo Usage: 

We understand that visually on GitHub all commits are coming from one user. This was done intentionally, as early in the development cycle we were facing issues with global and local variables breaking the functionality of the game. In order to combat this, all code was submitted to Jared and then merged on his local machine. We initiated local variables for almost all functions and then fed them to other functions to keep global function variable names from being confused, misused, or inadvertently changed. In order to showcase what each team member contributed every section of the code is labeled/commented with who completed it. Certain things like map design, and some of the sprite styling were done as a team, and these sections are labeled appropriately.

Again we understand that the first few weeks of the course were focused on understanding and competantly using Git, however we felt it was easier for our workflow to merge locally and review the code before committing. PICO-8 is unlike other development platforms where everything exists in a single file and is broken up into tabs. We found that doing each function separately (essentially as classes) and calling them accordingly was the most conducive to success for our project.
